## About LayerSwap

> With LayerSwap, you can send crypto from your crypto exchange account directly to Layer 2 networks without paying high Gas fees. 
> Supported networks include Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, Polygon and Ronin(Axie Infinity).

### How does it work?
Internal transactions between exchange accounts are free and instant. LayerSwap uses [Bransfer](https://bransfer.io) to receive crypto from your exchange account into the LayerSwap exchange account. 

When we detect the exchange transaction, we send the equal amount from the L2 liquidity pool to your provided wallet address. All of this happens instantly and without gas fees.

### What is Bransfer?
Bransfer makes it easy and safe for people to connect their crypto exchange accounts to apps and services.

### How much does it cost?
If you want to transfer 100$ worth of crypto from the crypto exchange to layer 2 networks, you have to pay ~70$ gas fees - one to send from the crypto exchange to your wallet and another for swapping it through the bridge. See [https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).

With LayerSwap, you just pay $15.

### How long does it take?
After you withdraw your crypto from the crypto exchange account, you will have assets available in the L2 network in 1-2 minutes.

### What are the limitations?
You can swap up to ~500$ worth of assets with LayerSwap now. This number is going to be changed as we open the liquidity pool for the community.

### Can I provide liquidity for LayerSwap?
Liquidity is provided only by LayerSwap now, but we are hard at work to release community liquidity mining by the end of 2021. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/layerswap) or join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KhwYN35sHy) to get updates!

### Can I send from L2 back to my exchange account?
This feature is under development. We plan to release it by the end of 2021.
