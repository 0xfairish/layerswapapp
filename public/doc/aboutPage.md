# About

With *LayerSwap*, you can send crypto from your Binance or Coinbase account directly to the Arbitrum network without paying high Gas fees.

## How does it work?
Internal transactions between exchange accounts are free and instant. LayerSwap uses [Bransfer](https://bransfer.io) to receive crypto from your exchange account into the LayerSwap exchange account. 

When we detect the exchange transaction, we send the equal amount from the Arbitrum liquidity pool to your provided Arbitrum address. All of this happens instantly and without gas fees.

## What is Bransfer?
Bransfer is a payment network running on top of crypto exchanges. It allows us to receive transactions from crypto exchanges instantly and without fees.

## How much does it cost?
If you want to transfer 100$ worth of crypto from the crypto exchange to the Arbitrum network, you have to pay ~70$ gas fees - one to send from the crypto exchange to your wallet and another for swapping it through the bridge. See [https://etherscan.io/gastracker](https://etherscan.io/gastracker).

With LayerSwap, you just pay $15.

## How long does it take?
After you withdraw your crypto from the crypto exchange account, you will have assets available in the Arbitrum network in 1-2 minutes.

## What are the limitations?
You can swap up to 500$ worth of assets with LayerSwap now. This number is going to be changed as we open the liquidity pool for the community.

## Can I provide liquidity for LayerSwap?
Liquidy is provided only by LayerSwap now, but we are hard at work to release community liquidity mining by the end of 2021. Follow us on [Twiiter](https://twitter.com/layerswap) or join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/KhwYN35sHy) to get updates!

## Can I send from Arbitrum back to my exchange account?
This feature is under development. We plan to release it by the end of 2021. 

## Who is building LayerSwap?
The team behind LayerSwap is the same team that made Bransfer. [Learn more about us](https://www.bransfer.io/about).
